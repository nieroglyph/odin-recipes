    <h2>Home-made steakhouse-quality Garlic Butter Steak</h2>
    <p>This <strong>Pan-Seared Steak</strong> has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that makes it taste steakhouse quality. You’ll be impressed at how easy it is to make the <em>perfect</em> steak – seared and caramelized on the outside, and <em>so juicy</em> inside.</p>
    <p>This <strong>20-minute recipe</strong> is done on the stovetop in one pan (no need to finish it in the oven). This is one of our <em>favorite</em> steak recipes and we make it year-round because it’s such a quick and convenient cooking method.</p>
